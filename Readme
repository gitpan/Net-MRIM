You'll find in this packaged:
- the module Net::MRIM, which is an API to the mail.ru agent network
- three example scripts, the first being an answering machine,
  and the second being a simple CLI client for mail.ru agent,
  and the third a simple GUI wxWidgets client.

You can use that CLI client, that support basic messaging. Edit
the file mrim.pl and enter your login information.
This is the most simple mail.ru agent client ever: only two files
are needed to make it work: mrim.pl and MRIM.pm.

I paid a lot of attention to be sure that it works on any platform.
This wasn't that easy, since the protocol was designed with x86 in mind.

It should work on any standard PERL with version > 5.8.

Everything in this package is licensed under the terms of the GPLv2.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THERE IS NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.
